# PharmAssist
A software application that assists healthcare facilities at PUP College of Engineering and Architecture in managing pharmaceutical stocks efficiently. Using Python's OOP principles with Tkinter GUI and SQLite database, it offers real-time inventory tracking, batch tracking, and role-based access control. This system reduces errors, saves time, ensures regulatory compliance, and provides clear visibility into inventory and consumption.

This software is our final project for the course in Object-Oriented Programming under Professor Engr. Cansino.

## Concepts Used
- Implemented `Tkinter` as the graphical user interface (GUI) framework for the application. This Python module facilitated the creation of responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
- `Encapsulated` properties and methods within modules (e.g., Medicine and User) using classes to manage internal states and enforce interaction via object methods.
- Utilized `inheritance` to derive Pharmacist class from the base class Table, promoting code reuse and establishing a structured hierarchy.
- Implemented interfaces to enable versatile generation of various report and analytics types, utilizing `polymorphism` to allow methods to handle objects differently based on their class or data type.
- `Abstracted` complex tasks such as inventory tracking and report preparation to present users with a streamlined interface that focuses on essential information.
- Integrated `SQLite` as the database management system to efficiently store and manage application data.
